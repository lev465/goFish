This program is a computer-ran game of Go Fish between two players.
The program runs a game of Go Fish and outputs a log of the game into a .txt file called gofish_results.txt

To run the program in the kamek.ece.utexas.edu environment:

	unzip prog06_lev465.zip
	module load gcc
	make
	./go_fish

At this point, the log file for the game will be created. To view the log file:

	vi gofish_results.txt

This will display the moves of the players in the game, as well as results.
